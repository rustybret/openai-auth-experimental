# Architecture

## Pattern Overview

**Overall:** Multi-account OAuth plugin with Codex request rewriting, reactive account fallback, credit-budget-aware sticky routing, Claustrum vault custody, push-based quota tracking with background idle polling, prompt-cache stabilization, idle cache keep-warm, and a separate TUI sidebar communicating over a loopback RPC.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Registers as the built-in `openai` provider; OpenCode loads external server plugins after its internal ones, so this package transparently supersedes OpenCode's internal OpenAI auth hook.
- Rewrites OpenAI Responses requests into Codex's wire shape (headers, body, tools, turn metadata) so the Codex backend treats traffic as if it came from the official Codex CLI.
- Reactive account fallback for ordered modes, plus sticky-balanced cold-session placement. Sticky pins migrate only on confirmed exhaustion — an exhausted rate-limit window or a reached credit budget — or permanent auth failure; there is no mid-session rebalance or Retry-After hold. Enforce the killswitch as a hard circuit-breaker directly on the request path to block requests or filter candidates before spending when cached quota falls below configured thresholds.
- Push-based quota tracking with background idle polling: quota comes in-band from `x-codex-*` HTTP response headers or `codex.rate_limits` WS frames, while an unref'd jittered background timer refreshes idle accounts across processes under a shared lease lock to keep sidebar and routing quota fresh without extra polling on active traffic. Wham/usage also carries a spend-control credit budget and reset-credit counts, normalized alongside the rate-limit windows.
- Optional Claustrum vault custody: a persisted `claustrum.mode` arms the vault path, where a tombstoned account serves only its vault-held credential and local refresh goes inert. Every routing and refresh decision reads one custody verdict per account; entering or leaving the mode is a guarded, fingerprint-fenced transition, and a background runtime keeps the credential cache warm.
- Three transport modes share the cache-stabilizer behavior: HTTP/SSE, native WebSocket, and a hand-rolled RFC 6455 WebSocket (Bun.connect or node:net/node:tls).
- TUI sidebar reads a serialized, machine-global `sidebar-state.json` snapshot pushed by the auth loader; it owns SHA-256-keyed sticky assignments with a seven-day TTL and renders the per-account custody state. The loader and TUI exchange dialogs/notifications over a loopback HTTP RPC bound to a per-process token.
- Plugin is split into a shared, provider-agnostic core package (`packages/core/src/`, imported as `@cortexkit/openai-auth-core`) and Codex-specific seams (`provider.ts`, `oauth.ts`) so the same shape could host another OAuth provider. Host-only behavior — cache keep-warm, sticky routing, the Claustrum custody runtime, background quota polling, and account-path resolution — stays in `packages/opencode/src/core/`.

## Layers

**Provider injection seam:**
- Purpose: Generic types (`ProviderRefreshFn`, `ProviderQuotaFn`, `ProviderHttpError`) plus the two Codex-specific fns (`codexRefreshFn`, `whamUsageFn`).
- Location: `packages/core/src/provider.ts`
- Contains: Token-refresh function type, quota-fetch function type, error shape carrying `status` + `retryAfter`, Codex OAuth constants, Codex HTTP refresh impl (with 15s timeout), Codex `wham/usage` quota fetch impl (with 15s timeout and logger warning).
- Depends on: `core/backoff.ts` (`parseRetryAfter`); dynamic-imported `quota-normalize.ts` (avoids a load-time cycle).
- Used by: `FallbackAccountManager` and `QuotaManager` constructors; `index.ts` plugin loader.

**Accounts and fallback storage:**
- Purpose: Atomic, multi-account JSON store with file locks, retry/backoff state, killswitch config, routing mode, persisted quota, log level, and dump/cachekeep toggles.
- Location: `packages/core/src/accounts.ts`, `packages/core/src/atomic-write.ts`, `packages/core/src/refresh-file-lock.ts`, `packages/core/src/paths.ts` (shared file names + `deriveStatePath`), plus the host path resolver `packages/opencode/src/core/account-paths.ts`
- Contains: `deriveStatePath` in `account-paths.ts` (derives `${configPath}.state.json` when custom config paths are used, preventing distinct account files from sharing one state document, with `accountPathsCollide` detecting aliases), `loadAccounts`/`migrateIfNeeded` (serialized under the shared save lock to coordinate concurrent migrations and mutations), `mutateAccounts` (authoritative read-modify-write for structural mutations and scalar writes, preserving load-dropped raw entries on disk with an `allowDrop` option for intentional caller removals, preventing concurrent union-merge resurrection of deleted accounts/secrets), `withAccountStoreTransaction` (write-mode store transaction used by the custody transition to fence a mode write against the roster), `saveAccounts` (test seeding only), `saveAccountState` (updates state secrets, gated by config roster to prevent resurrection of deleted account secrets), `claustrumMode` (reads the persisted `claustrum.mode`, defaulting any absent/other value to `local`), `FallbackAccountManager` (background refresh, `getUsableFallbackAccounts`, fire-and-forget `markUsed` telemetry, and a required `AccountManagerCustodyOptions` `custody` field whose absence would silently re-enable local refresh), `OAuthAccount`/`CorruptOAuthAccount`/`ApiKeyAccount` types, single-writer eviction-marker file lock with separated acquire window, lock TTL, and generation-fenced renewal and release (distinguishes holder contention from event-loop starvation in timeout errors, verifies owner and marker identity to avoid deleting or extending a successor's lock, and recreates missing parent directories automatically on `ENOENT`), atomic JSON write (temp + rename, mode `0o600`).
- Depends on: `core/oauth.ts` (`extractAccountId`), `core/custody.ts` (tombstone recognition + fingerprints), `core/custody-manifest.ts` (`CustodyManifestReadResult`), `core/provider.ts` (`ProviderQuotaFn`), `core/backoff.ts`.
- Used by: Plugin loader, `/openai-account`/`/openai-routing`/`/openai-killswitch` commands, every quota push.

**Quota cache and policy:**
- Purpose: In-memory cache of main + per-fallback quota snapshots, dedup of inflight fetches, refresh-after math, backoff gating, and mid-stream rate-limit marks.
- Location: `packages/core/src/quota-manager.ts`, `packages/core/src/refresh-all-quota.ts`, plus `packages/opencode/src/core/background-quota-refresh.ts` and `packages/opencode/src/core/sticky-routing.ts`
- Contains: `QuotaManager` class with `getMain`/`setMain`/`getFallback`/`setFallback`/`seedFallbacksFromAccounts`/`isBackedOff`/`isFallbackBackedOff`, rate limit marking (`markRateLimited`, `isRateLimited`, `rateLimitedUntil`), stable-identity policy peeks (`peekMainForPolicy`, `peekFallbackForPolicy`) to prevent token refreshes from invalidating cached quota, token-fingerprint helpers, `refreshAllQuota` orchestration (treats quota endpoint 401s as token refresh triggers, skips poll attempts for accounts with armed non-transient refresh backoff by marking them permanent failures, resolves a custody-inert account's token through the resolver and reports a vault-served 401 back to the vault, and displays quota readings with their own age when older than 15 minutes), `BackgroundQuotaRefresh` (unref'd 5-minute jittered poll with 4-minute freshness gating and auto-renewed `bg-quota-refresh` file lease lock), and `sticky-routing.ts` candidate selection and break classification (`selectStickyCandidate`, `decideStickyBreak`, `sustainableWindowWeight`). The credit budget is a third pressure axis on its own monthly reset clock: `spendControlExhaustedResetAt` in `sidebar-state.ts` is the single shared exhaustion signal that admission, cold placement, and warm-pin migration all read, judged by the provider's authoritative `reached` boolean and failing open on a stale or missing reset. `getPresentQuotaWindows`/`exhaustedQuotaResetAt`/`isQuotaExhausted` in `sidebar-state.ts` back the killswitch and admission checks. Mid-stream rate-limit reset resolution (`resolveMidStreamRateLimitResetAt`) prefers explicit provider resets (e.g. from admission-time errors or HTTP/WS 429 upgrade frames) over cached named-window resets or bounded defaults. Policies drop cached window snapshots when their reset timestamps are in the past.
- Depends on: `core/accounts.ts` types, `core/provider.ts` (`ProviderQuotaFn` injection), `core/refresh-file-lock.ts`, `sidebar-state.ts`.
- Used by: Plugin loader (push updates and background poller), `refresh-all-quota.ts` (active polling for `/openai-quota`).

**Backoff and retry policy:**
- Purpose: Classify refresh and quota errors as transient vs non-transient, build retry records, expose `*BackoffActive` checks.
- Location: `packages/core/src/backoff.ts`
- Contains: `isTransientRefreshError`, `isTransientQuotaError`, `buildRefreshOperationError`, `buildQuotaOperationError`, `hashRefreshToken`, `refreshBackoffActive`, `quotaBackoffActive`, `parseRetryAfter`.
- Depends on: `node:crypto`.
- Used by: `accounts.ts`, `quota-manager.ts`, `refresh-file-lock.ts`, plugin loader (`refreshMainWithLease`).

**OAuth flow:**
- Purpose: PKCE generation, OAuth authorize-URL building, local callback HTTP server, device-code flow, JWT/account-id extraction, fallback-account onboarding.
- Location: `packages/core/src/oauth.ts`
- Contains: `CLIENT_ID`, `ISSUER`, `OAUTH_PORT`, PKCE helpers, `startOAuthServer`, `waitForOAuthCallback`, `beginDeviceAuth`, `completeDeviceAuth`, `buildAuthorizeUrl`, `flowCleanup`, `parseJwtClaims`, `extractAccountIdFromClaims`, `beginAccountLogin`, `upsertAccount`.
- Depends on: `node:http`, `node:timers/promises`, `version.ts`.
- Used by: Plugin loader (`/login openai` `methods`), `/openai-account add`.

**Claustrum vault custody:**
- Purpose: Vault-aware OAuth fallback resolution. A persisted `claustrum.mode` arms the vault path: a tombstoned fallback serves only its vault-held credential, local refresh and local serving go inert, and the vault is consulted for the served identity. Enroll a manifest-bound account, fence a served credential's identity against its bound account, and project a per-account custody verdict to the sidebar.
- Location: `packages/core/src/custody.ts` (policy core, credential cache, resolver), `packages/core/src/custody-manifest.ts` (manifest reader), and host-owned `packages/opencode/src/core/custody-state.ts` (verdict table), `packages/opencode/src/core/custody-transition.ts` (enter/leave barrier), `packages/opencode/src/core/custody-host-slot.ts` (main-slot classification), `packages/opencode/src/core/custody-runtime.ts` (boot/tick runtime), `packages/opencode/src/core/custody-manifest.ts` (host manifest path + core re-exports). See `packages/opencode/docs/custody-state-machine.md` for the full coordinate/verdict tables.
- Contains: `tombstoned`/`enrolled`/`custodied`/`enrolling`/`excluded`/`refreshInert` predicates; `canonicalCustodyTombstone` and `custodyTombstoneKey` (`claustrum-tombstone:v1:<provider>`); `custodySlotFingerprint` (length-prefixed SHA-256 over the access/refresh pair); `ClaustrumCredentialCache` (resident records, single-flight `get`, version-fenced `reportAuthFailure` with a two-report reauth bound); `verifyServedFallbackIdentity`; `resolveFallbackAccess`; `reconcileFallbackCustody` (enroll-completion sweep that tombstones only after a served claim matches an existing bind); `evaluateCustodyStartup` (the `mode × manifest × local × vault` verdict table); `classifyMainAuthSlot` (real/tombstone/empty/indeterminate, with a two-read, 250 ms-apart absence confirmation); `enterClaustrumMode`/`leaveClaustrumMode` (mutex + renewable `claustrum-mode` lock + renewable per-account locks in sorted identity order, fingerprint-fenced writes, post-write host readback); `CustodyRuntime` (boot sweep, 5-minute jittered tick, discovery/install/resume passes, sidebar projection); `readCustodyManifest` (lstat/O_NOFOLLOW/fstat, `0o600` file and `0o700` parent enforcement, 256 KiB cap, owning-provider filter).
- Depends on: `node:crypto`, `node:fs/promises`, `@cortexkit/claustrum-client` (handle file types + `ClaustrumClient`/`detectClaustrumConnection`/`getDefaultClaustrumConnectionPath`), `core/accounts.ts` (`claustrumMode`, `withAccountStoreTransaction`, `fallbackRefreshLockName`), `core/refresh-file-lock.ts`, `core/oauth.ts` (`parseJwtClaims`, `extractAccountIdFromClaims`).
- Used by: Plugin loader (custody runtime + auth methods wrapping), `FallbackAccountManager`, `refreshAllQuota`, `/openai-account` (`claustrum`/`local`), sidebar state. Handle values and credential payloads never reach logs or thrown-error messages.

**Cache keep-warm:**
- Purpose: Track idle main-agent (and optionally subagent) sessions and replay the last real request as a `store:false` shadow request just before Codex evicts the prompt cache. Employs model-aware TTL (raising GPT-5.6 TTL to 30 min from the 5-min default), gpt-5.6 subagent 2-warm caps, a process clock-bound window (outside of which warming and capture are skipped), and extended subagent idle bounds (75 min for GPT-5.6 subagents). `sustain` defaults off and bypasses only main idle pruning; it leaves the clock window, subagent limits, target-count, byte, and LRU caps intact.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/core/cachekeep.ts`
- Contains: `CacheKeepManager` class (target map, timer, idle caps, backoff), `buildKeepwarmCapture`, `buildKeepwarmBody`, model-aware TTL matcher (`isGpt56Model`, `ttlForModel`), clock window checker (`isWithinCacheKeepWindow`), SSE/JSON usage extraction.
- Depends on: `core/accounts.ts` (`findCachekeepFallbackAccount` exported from `index.ts`), `quota-normalize.ts`.
- Used by: Plugin loader (per-instance wiring); `/openai-cachekeep` command.

**Request transformation:**
- Purpose: Convert OpenAI Responses calls into Codex-shaped wire requests (UUIDv7 thread/turn ids, Codex turn-metadata header, OAuth/ChatGPT account headers, client_metadata, tool normalization, cache-stabilizer injection, key-reordering via `orderCodexBody` to match Codex wire serialization), with an opt-in Responses Lite shape for the models the backend catalog marks `use_responses_lite` (`gpt-5.6-sol`/`-terra`/`-luna` and every `gpt-6` variant). Responses Lite trades capabilities for compact requests by disabling parallel tool calls, moving system instructions and tools into developer messages prefixing the input sequence, excluding hosted tools, and stripping details from images. Preserves OpenCode's native `max` reasoning variant on the wire, sets the Codex client version to `0.155.0` (required for `gpt-6-sol` and `gpt-6-luna`; `gpt-6-astra` needs `0.153.0`, and one version serves the whole range), caps `gpt-5.6` variants, `gpt-6-sol`, and `gpt-6-luna` context and input (244k input, 372k context) to stay within OpenAI's cheap pricing tier below the 272k 2x-pricing threshold, while `gpt-6-astra` alone receives its full reported window (744k input, 872k context) exempt from the Codex long-context surcharge at the default endpoint. Preserves byte-identical prefix caches for `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6-sol`, and `gpt-6-luna` by pinning request-level reasoning effort to session-opening values and carrying mid-conversation effort changes as `configuration_update` input items immediately preceding the new user turn (models outside `MID_CONVERSATION_EFFORT_MODELS`, such as `gpt-5.6-sol`, retain standard request-level effort updates), and filters legacy experimental `-pro` model entries and bare disallowed IDs (`gpt-5.6`, `gpt-6`) while accepting major/minor versions `> 5.4` (such as `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`). Resolves and preserves model/variant context for synthetic command replies to prevent model regression.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/index.ts` (`prepareCodexRequest`, `maybeInjectCacheStabilizerTool`, `applyMidConversationEffort`, `normalizeCodexTool`, `getCodexSessionMetadata`, `loadCodexSessions`/`saveCodexSessions`, `ALLOWED_MODELS`/`DISALLOWED_MODELS`/`RESPONSES_LITE_MODELS`/`MID_CONVERSATION_EFFORT_MODELS`/`CODEX_VERSION`), `packages/opencode/src/codex-http.ts` (`sanitizeHttpFallbackInit`, `sanitizeHttpFallbackBody`, `hasWebSocketResponsesLiteMetadata`), `packages/opencode/src/hosted-web-search.ts` (provider-hosted web-search tool + replay rewrite + SSE translation), `packages/opencode/src/prompt-context.ts` (`resolvePromptContext`), `packages/opencode/src/response-stream-error.ts`.
- Depends on: `util/uuid-v7.ts`, `util/stable-json.ts`, `packages/core/src/util/record.ts` (`isRecord`), `config.ts`.
- Used by: Plugin loader `sendWithAccessToken`, `fetch` override.

**Transports:**
- Purpose: Run Codex requests over HTTP or WebSocket, with a session-keyed pool for the WebSocket path and Codex-style incremental streaming when the hand-rolled client is enabled. WebSocket connection starts with a prompt-prewarming phase (sending a `generate: false` body to populate the session's prompt cache and establish continuation state) before sending the main turn. Intercepts rate-limit notifications on prewarm and main connections (including admission-time `usage_limit_reached` frames and 429 handshake upgrade rejections parsed via `raw-ws-upgrade.ts`) via the `onRateLimitReached` callback to mark the account rate-limited with explicit provider resets. Applies a no-replay gate (forces a retryable `ResponseStreamError` only if no generated output item — including tool/function calls — was yet emitted (`emittedOutput`), enabling a same-turn fallback reroute on the stock `@ai-sdk/openai` runtime, else closes the stream to prevent duplication, double-billing, or re-running side-effecting tools; note that same-turn rerouting is bypassed under the experimental native runtime `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_NATIVE_LLM=1` where the errored body rejects with a non-retryable error, though the mark still steers the next turn off that account). Handles oversized WebSocket request frames (close code 1009) by marking them non-retryable on WebSocket; `relayWithOversizedFallback` in `ws-pool.ts` intercepts oversized frame failures on the returned response body and, provided no output bytes were yet delivered to the consumer, transparently issues the request over HTTP and streams the fallback response to finish the turn without spending futile retries. When a socket closes or continuation fails before output, the socket is destroyed and continuation state is cleared so retried turns resend full input rather than chaining to a refused response. In hand-rolled WebSocket clients (`raw-ws-bun.ts`, `raw-ws-node.ts`), parsed peer close frames take precedence over synthetic 1006 TCP close events. Transport lifecycle logging records `response.created` (with response ID and continuation tracking) and stream death diagnostics (frames produced, elapsed time, and continuation context) ungated by request-dump settings.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/ws.ts` (WS connect/stream, header ordering, idle timeout, retryable terminal hook, mid-stream event parser), `packages/opencode/src/ws-pool.ts` (account pool keyed by ChatGPT account ID or token hash fallback to prevent token refreshes from busting continuation chains, turn rotation via shared `advanceTurn`, prewarm connection limit failover, `OpenAIWebSocketPool`), `packages/opencode/src/raw-ws.ts` (runtime selection), `packages/opencode/src/raw-ws-bun.ts` (`Bun.connect`), `packages/opencode/src/raw-ws-node.ts` (`node:net`/`node:tls`), `packages/opencode/src/raw-ws-upgrade.ts` (handshake upgrade 4xx/5xx status & header parser), `packages/opencode/src/util/proxy-env.ts`.
- Depends on: `dump.ts`, `hosted-web-search.ts`, `packages/core/src/quota-normalize.ts`, `response-stream-error.ts`, `packages/core/src/util/error.ts` (`errorMessage`), `packages/core/src/util/record.ts` (`isRecord`).
- Used by: Plugin loader `sendWithAccessToken`.

**RPC (loader ↔ TUI):**
- Purpose: Loopback HTTP server so the TUI can drain queued notifications and dispatch `apply` calls back to the auth loader (which already holds QuotaManager / FallbackAccountManager / storage).
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/rpc/rpc-server.ts`, `packages/opencode/src/rpc/port-file.ts`, `packages/opencode/src/rpc/rpc-client.ts`, `packages/opencode/src/rpc/rpc-dir.ts`, `packages/opencode/src/rpc/protocol.ts` (re-export of the wire types in `packages/core/src/protocol.ts`), `packages/opencode/src/rpc/notifications.ts`.
- Contains: 32-byte hex token, 1 MiB body cap, timed-out HTTP requests (2s), per-process port files (`port-<pid>.json`, mode `0o600`), pid-based discovery (drops dead pids), SHA-256(project-dir) `XDG_STATE_HOME/cortexkit/openai-auth/rpc/openai-auth-<hash>/` (mode `0o700`) with startup sweeps for dead port files and empty project directories, queue with monotonic IDs and per-session TUI-connected tracking.
- Depends on: `node:crypto`, `node:http`, `node:fs/promises`.
- Used by: Plugin loader (server + notifications push), `tui.tsx` (RPC client polling + dialog delivery).

**TUI sidebar:**
- Purpose: Render an OpenCode sidebar slot showing main/fallback quota bars, routing/killswitch/health state, and the command dialog surfaces. The TUI does not own any auth state — it reads `sidebar-state.json`, resolves the session-safe active account via `resolveSessionSidebarRouting`, and pushes commands via RPC.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/tui.tsx`, `packages/opencode/src/tui/entry.mjs`, generated `packages/opencode/src/tui-compiled/`, `packages/opencode/src/tui/command-dialogs.tsx`, `packages/opencode/src/sidebar-state.ts`, `packages/opencode/src/tui-preferences.ts`.
- Depends on: `@opentui/core`, `@opentui/solid`, `solid-js`, `jsonc-parser`.
- Used by: OpenCode's TUI plugin loader (`./tui` export).

**Quota normalization:**
- Purpose: One place to coerce three quota shapes (HTTP `x-codex-*` headers, WS `codex.rate_limits` frame, wham/usage JSON) into the shared `OAuthQuotaSnapshot`, including reset-timestamp coercion (epoch seconds/ms/ISO).
- Location: `packages/core/src/quota-normalize.ts`
- Contains: `normalizeQuotaHeaders`, `normalizeWsFrame`, `normalizeWham`, `toResetIso`.
- Used by: Plugin loader (push), `refresh-all-quota.ts`, `cachekeep.ts`, `provider.ts` (dynamic import to avoid a cycle).

**Model cost restoration:**
- Purpose: Restore real model costs from a local cache or a remote catalog (`models.dev`) when cost zeroing is disabled.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/model-costs.ts`
- Contains: `loadModelsDevCosts`, `resetModelCostsForTest`, `toSdkCost` with strict price validation, `modelsCachePath` checking `OPENCODE_OPENAI_AUTH_MODELS_CACHE`/`OPENCODE_MODELS_PATH` env vars and falling back to XDG cache, and catalog caching with a timeout-backed fetch.
- Depends on: `node:fs/promises`, `node:os`, `node:path`.
- Used by: `packages/opencode/src/index.ts` models provider hook.

**Settings and logging:**
- Purpose: Resolve plugin settings from env + config file, and provide a leveled, secret-redacting, size-rotating logger.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/config.ts`, `packages/core/src/logger.ts` (redaction + rotation engine) with the host destination shim `packages/opencode/src/logger.ts`, `packages/opencode/src/dump.ts`.
- Contains: `getSettings`, `refreshSettings` (invalidates the process-memoized settings cache so commands that modify configuration on disk take effect without a restart), `getConfigDir`, `getConfigPath`, `DEFAULT_CODEX_API_ENDPOINT`; leveled logger with key/value redaction (`redact`) and credential string scrubbing (`redactStrings`) for Bearer/sk-/JWT tokens, secret/api-key/password/token-like keys; 5 MiB log rotation keeping 3 generations; request-dump writer with redaction for `authorization`/`chatgpt-account-id`/`cookie`/`set-cookie`, embedding `process.pid` in filenames to avoid collisions across processes and restarts, recovering diff baselines from existing disk dumps across restarts, diffing on redacted body text so offsets match `.body.json`, and preserving tool schema properties via `redactStrings` so definitions remain valid and captures remain replayable.
- Depends on: `node:os`, `node:path`, `node:fs`.
- Used by: Plugin loader, command implementations, every logger channel (`transport`, `quota`, `refresh`, `accounts`, `cachekeep`, `rpc`, `dump`, `sidebar`, `commands`, `rpc-tui`).

**Utilities:**
- Purpose: Small, dependency-free helpers shared by every layer.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/util/` (`proxy-env.ts`, `stable-json.ts`, `uuid-v7.ts`) plus `packages/core/src/util/` (`error.ts`, `record.ts`, `open-url.ts`) for the helpers both hosts share.
- Contains: `errorMessage`, `ProxyEnv.getProxyForUrl` (Bun honors `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`), `isRecord`, `stableStringify`, `uuidV7` (UUIDv7 with ms timestamp prefix), cross-platform `openUrl`.
- Used by: Everywhere.

**Commands (dialogs):**
 - Purpose: Per-slash-command payload builders producing `OpenDialogPayload` (text + knobs) and applying user selections to storage. Copies the command context copy per invocation to prevent concurrent sessions from crossing feedback. Projects identity fields and scrubs credentials from knob payloads before sending over RPC. The shared bodies (quota, account, routing, reset, plus the dispatch and scrubbing) live in `packages/core/src/commands.ts` with module-private `execute*` bodies; the four host-owned bodies (killswitch, dump, logging, cachekeep) live in `packages/opencode/src/commands.ts` as `hostCommandBodies` and run through the core's `buildDialogPayload`/`applyCommand` so scrubbing applies uniformly.
 - Location: `packages/core/src/commands.ts` (shared bodies + seam), `packages/opencode/src/commands.ts` (host bodies + re-exported seam)
 - Contains: Command name constants (`OPENAI_*_COMMAND_NAME`), `MODAL_COMMANDS`, `CommandContext` DI shape, `buildDialogPayload`, `applyCommand`, `scrubKnobs`, `hostCommandBodies`.
- Depends on: `core/accounts.ts`, `core/cachekeep.ts`, `core/oauth.ts`, `core/refresh-all-quota.ts`, `core/reset-credits.ts`, `quota-manager.ts`, `rpc/protocol.ts`, `logger.ts`, `config.ts`.
- Used by: Plugin loader (`auth.loader`), RPC `apply` dispatch.

**Auth methods and the account menu:**
- Purpose: The three `/login openai` entries, plus an account menu rendered inside `opencode auth login` on a machine past its first sign-in. Replaces the removed `openai-auth` binary.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/auth/methods.ts` (entries, menu actions, `createAuthMethods`), `packages/opencode/src/auth/doctor.ts` (`createAuthDoctorReport`, `findStoredMainCredential`), `packages/opencode/src/auth/ui/` (`auth-menu.ts`, `select.ts`, `confirm.ts`, `ansi.ts` — first-party terminal code, no prompt library).
- Contains: Six actions (add account, auth current, check quotas, auth doctor, apply repairs, delete all accounts); the doctor's findings and their repairs; `AUTH_MENU_ACTIONS`.
- Key behaviours: `authorize(inputs?)` receives `inputs` only from the CLI, so the TUI path is unchanged. The menu opens when a main credential exists, not when the fallback roster is non-empty — gating on the roster hid it from the user adding their first fallback. Every action returns a failed callback (`AuthOAuthResult` has no top-level failure shape), because add writes a *fallback* and reporting it as a login would file it as the main credential; the resulting `Failed to authorize` line is captured in `docs/baselines/opencode-auth-menu.v1.18.30.txt`. Delete-all passes an explicit id list to `allowDrop`, built inside the mutation from the raw roster ids `mutateAccounts` exposes.
- Depends on: `packages/core/src/index.ts` and `./internal`, `refresh-all-quota.ts`, the loader-captured `getAuth`, `client.auth.set`.
- Used by: `packages/opencode/src/index.ts` `auth.methods`.

**Pi extension (sibling package):**
- Purpose: Same Codex OAuth capability for the Pi coding agent (separate OpenAI Codex Responses API surface), plus the shared account commands.
- Location: `packages/pi/src/index.ts`, `packages/pi/src/commands.ts`, `packages/pi/src/paths.ts`, `packages/pi/src/routing.ts`, `packages/pi/src/raw-ws-node.ts`
- Contains: Provider registration (`openai-codex`), model list (`gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`), custom streaming wrapper, hand-rolled WebSocket shim, and thin wrappers registering `openai-account`, `openai-quota` and `openai-routing` over the shared core bodies. Not `openai-reset`: it spends an irreversible credit bound to a ChatGPT identity Pi has no concept of.
- Storage: its own paths (`PI_OPENAI_AUTH_FILE` else `PI_AGENT_DIR` else `~/.pi/agent`), never the `OPENCODE_*` variables for either file.
- Known gap: the Pi request path does not read the store, so a routing choice persists without moving traffic. Tracked as issue #153.
- Depends on: `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (imported via `/compat` to match Pi loader's alias table), `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `node:net`/`node:tls`, `@cortexkit/openai-auth-core`.
- Used by: Pi extension loader.

## Data Flow

**OAuth login + token refresh (main account):**

1. User runs `/login openai` and picks "ChatGPT Pro/Plus (browser)" or "(headless)" — `packages/opencode/src/index.ts` `auth.methods`.
2. `startOAuthServer` + `generatePKCE` + `buildAuthorizeUrl` open the authorize URL — `packages/core/src/oauth.ts`.
3. `waitForOAuthCallback` (browser) or `beginDeviceAuth` + `completeDeviceAuth` (headless) completes the flow.
4. `migrateIfNeeded` seeds the multi-account store on first run, serializing operations under the shared save lock to coordinate concurrent migrations and mutations — `packages/core/src/accounts.ts`.
5. `auth.loader` constructs `QuotaManager`, `FallbackAccountManager`, and (if any fallback accounts) starts `fallbackManager.startBackgroundRefresh()`.
6. Each refresh runs through `codexRefreshFn` with file-lock + lease concurrency — `core/refresh-file-lock.ts`, `index.ts` `refreshMainWithLease`. Refreshed token persistence retries up to 3 times to prevent transient file locks or API write errors from invalidating sessions.

**Routing and request flow (per request):**

1. Resolve the session key from `x-session-affinity`, `x-opencode-session`, `x-session-id`, or `session-id`.
2. Read the shared sidebar state once. In `sticky-balanced` mode, retain a valid pin or create one using least projected pressure against fresh quota; stale and unknown quota are excluded, and an empty weighted set fails open to configured order. The credit budget is a third pressure axis with its own monthly reset, so a spent budget lowers a candidate's weight as well; equal scores use configured order then account id, while a shared pending-byte bridge accounts for concurrent cold sessions. Resolve each account's custody access first, so a refused or excluded account never enters the roster.
3. Strip any existing `authorization` header, refresh an expired main token via `refreshMainWithLease`, or refresh a fallback via `fallbackManager.refreshAccount`. Derive the main ChatGPT identity from the access-token JWT so quota and killswitch tracking survive a main-account switch. A custody-inert fallback's token comes from `resolveFallbackAccess` instead of a local refresh.
4. Consult admission before spending. A candidate whose freshest known quota — in-process cache or the shared sidebar file, whichever is newer under a matching account identity — is exhausted is skipped rather than probed; exhaustion includes a reached credit budget, judged by the same shared signal cold placement uses. Filtering can never remove the last path: if it would, the original order is restored and the wire stays authoritative.
5. Send on the chosen account. Ordered modes retain their normal main-first or fallback-first retry behavior; sticky-balanced does not rebalance a live session and has no Retry-After hold. A blocked primary returns a synthetic 429 whose `Retry-After` comes from the blocking reason's own reset.
6. Classify a sticky break after the send. Only confirmed exhaustion — an exhausted rate-limit window or a reached credit budget — and permanent auth failure migrate the pin; transient, stale, and unknown outcomes retain it. A response that already served is never replayed.
7. Repin immediately on migration, then write the served account to the display state. Telemetry updates (`markUsed`) run fire-and-forget so a served response is never delayed by storage contention. Main and fallback quota headers are normalized into `QuotaManager`; `activeRouting` remains a short-lived display record, while `stickyAssignments` owns the seven-day, SHA-256-keyed session pins. A child session uses its own pin, and the parent display keeps its own pin rather than mirroring the child.

**Quota push and background refresh:**

1. HTTP path — `normalizeQuotaHeaders(finalResponse.headers)` runs inside the `fetch` override.
2. WS path — `codex.rate_limits` in-band frame fires `onQuota` in `ws.ts`, which calls back into `pushQuota` carrying the connection's per-request access token, internal quota account key, and the served ChatGPT account ID header to prevent cross-account leakage.
3. `pushQuota` writes to `QuotaManager.setMain`/`setFallback` (discarding stale main frames and past-expired windows) and triggers `writeMachineSidebarState` (updates machine-global state in the sidebar snapshot using `setSidebarMachineState`).
4. Background polling — `BackgroundQuotaRefresh` runs an unref'd 5-minute jittered interval under the `bg-quota-refresh` file lease lock, invoking `refreshAllQuota` with a 4-minute freshness threshold (`BACKGROUND_QUOTA_FRESHNESS_MS`) to keep idle fallback and main quota fresh in the shared sidebar state. Window snapshots merge per window by newest `checkedAt`; a same-identity merge keeps the fresher of each window (and of `spendControl`), while a differing or unknown identity whole-picks the fresher snapshot.
5. `/openai-quota` command additionally calls `refreshAllQuota` directly to actively fetch `wham/usage` for main + every fallback (respecting per-account backoff).

**Claustrum custody (startup, request, and transition):**

1. On load, `readCustodyManifest` reads the owning `openai`/`oauth`/`openai-auth` block from `$CLAUSTRUM_OPENCODE_HANDLES` (else `<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/cortexkit/opencode-handles.json`); `evaluateCustodyStartup` resolves each account's `mode × manifest × local × vault` coordinate into `LOCAL`, `VAULT`, `INERT:<reason>`, or `NEEDS_LOGIN` — the complete table lives in `packages/opencode/docs/custody-state-machine.md`.
2. Under `mode=claustrum`, the request path resolves a fallback through `resolveFallbackAccess`: a tombstoned account serves only its vault-held credential, `enrolling` accounts serve local material, and anything the vault cannot prove is `CUSTODY_REFUSE`/`CUSTODY_EXCLUDED`. `verifyServedFallbackIdentity` refuses a positive identity contradiction but serves through an unverifiable claim (vault silence is not a mismatch on a verify path).
3. `CustodyRuntime.boot()` runs the initial completion sweep, then a 5-minute jittered tick performs discovery, enroll-completion, fingerprint resume, and fallback tombstone-install passes. The runtime owns the `ClaustrumCredentialCache` and hands a live per-account projection to the sidebar writer; a loader without a connected vault still owns a no-op runtime to dispose.
4. Entering the mode runs `enterClaustrumMode`: acquire the process-local custody mutex and the renewable `claustrum-mode` lock, then renewable per-account locks in sorted identity order; preflight every participant; capture manifest revision, store generation, and each slot's `custodySlotFingerprint`; write `claustrum.mode = "claustrum"` with the transition fingerprints; tombstone only fingerprint-matching slots; and for main require non-empty `auth.all()` plus post-write host readback. Crash rows are monotone — before the mode write nothing destructive happened, after it resume only fingerprint-matching tombstones. Leaving writes `mode=local` only; it does not clear bindings or restore tokens.
5. `/openai-account claustrum` and `/openai-account local` drive the transition through the command bodies; the TUI account dialog surfaces the current mode as an enter/leave option. `claustrumMode(storage)` defaults any absent or unrecognized value to `local`.

**Slash command (TUI dialog):**

1. OpenCode TUI fires `command.execute.before` for `/openai-*`.
2. The plugin returns `cleanAbort()` (sentinel throw) so OpenCode does NOT execute any built-in command — `packages/opencode/src/index.ts`.
3. The plugin pushes an `open-dialog` notification via `pushNotification` (`packages/opencode/src/rpc/notifications.ts`).
4. TUI's `tui.tsx` polls the loader's loopback RPC (`/rpc/pending-notifications`), receives the dialog, and renders it via `command-dialogs.tsx`.
5. User clicks Apply → TUI POSTs `/rpc/apply` → loader's `apply` calls `buildDialogPayload`, mutates storage via `mutateAccounts`, and returns updated knobs for the TUI to re-render.

**`/openai-reset` credit redemption:**

1. The account list reuses each account's valid L1 access token to fetch `wham/usage` and reset-credit inventory in parallel, producing a per-account preview. Exhausted accounts with an eligible credit in reset inventory (evaluated without rejecting when wham's `applicable_available_count` is zero or out of sync) and a stable ChatGPT account identity can continue.
2. Selecting an account opens an explicit L2 confirmation bound to its stable `chatgptAccountId`; the dialog states that one reset credit will be spent (showing the available credit count or unknown) and that the action is irreversible.
3. Confirmation resolves the target again and rejects the redemption if its ChatGPT identity no longer matches the bound identity.
4. A new attempt re-fetches quota and credits and re-checks exhaustion and applicable-credit preconditions immediately before claiming a credit. Under the persisted-pair retry rule (3a), an explicit retry instead requires an active in-flight attempt and reuses its `creditId` and `redeemRequestId` pair.
5. `consumeResetCredit` sends the explicit credit ID and redemption UUID to the consume endpoint in a POST bounded by a 60-second timeout. The read-only credit-list GET is bounded by a 15-second timeout; an abort surfaces as an `http_error` list failure.
6. Terminal server outcomes (`reset`, `already_redeemed`, `nothing_to_reset`, `no_credit`) clear the matching in-flight pair and persist `lastOutcome`; only the credit-spending `reset` and `already_redeemed` outcomes start cooldown. HTTP and ambiguous outcomes preserve the pair so a retry can reuse the same identifiers; an expired unreconciled pair requires an explicit replay, while corrupt local state is recorded as locally ambiguous instead of issuing a consume request.
7. A successful or already-redeemed outcome runs the normal targeted quota refresh for the selected account, pushes the result through `QuotaManager`, refreshes the sidebar snapshot, and fetches the remaining applicable-credit count.

Server-side deduplication of a repeated `redeem_request_id` is verified live (2026-07-23): replaying a consumed `(redeem_request_id, credit_id)` returns `already_redeemed` with `windows_reset: 0`, the account's available-credit count does not decrement a second time, and the response carries the original redemption's `redeemed_at`. Replaying a consumed identifier is therefore safe — the server dedupes on it and never spends another credit — which is the invariant the retry path relies on.

**Cache keep-warm (idle session):**

1. Every main-agent (and optionally subagent) request is captured by `buildKeepwarmCapture` from `sendWithAccessToken`. Outside of the configured clock window, capture is skipped.
2. `cacheKeepManager.track` stores the body + replay headers per session, computing `cacheExpiresAt` using model-aware TTL (30 min for GPT-5.6 models, 5 min otherwise).
3. A 60s timer fires; if the current hour is within the clock window, it checks each tracked session. For sessions within `leadMs` of expiry and within their respective idle caps (1 h main, 30 min subagent, or 75 min for GPT-5.6 subagents), it calls `buildKeepwarmBody(body)` (`store:false`, token caps removed) and replays via `fetchImpl`. With `sustain on`, only the main 1-hour idle pruning bound is bypassed; the window and all memory/LRU caps still apply.
4. Successful warms increment `warmCount`. A GPT-5.6 subagent session is immediately removed/evicted from tracking once its `warmCount` reaches the 2-warm cap.
5. Failures trigger a 10-min backoff per session.

## Key Abstractions

**`CodexAuthPlugin` (the plugin itself):**
- Purpose: Entry point for OpenCode's plugin system. Returns `Hooks` (auth, provider, tool, event, dispose).
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/index.ts`
- Pattern: Factory; accepts `PluginInput` + `CodexAuthPluginOptions`; wires the auth loader, the WebSocket pool, the RPC server, the custody runtime/bootstrap, and the per-loader `CacheKeepManager` set.

**`FallbackAccountManager`:**
 - Purpose: Owns the in-memory fallback state, background refresh, and `getUsableFallbackAccounts` (killswitch + routing + custody aware).
 - Location: `packages/core/src/accounts.ts`
- Pattern: Constructor-injected `refreshFn` (`codexRefreshFn`), `quotaManager`, and a required `custody` policy reader; background timer with on-demand `markUsed` to refresh before the next request. A custody-refresh-inert account reports its state instead of performing a local refresh.

**`CustodyRuntime`:**
- Purpose: Owns the boot/tick loop, the credential cache, and the sidebar custody projection for one loader process.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/core/custody-runtime.ts`
- Pattern: Dependency-injected factory (`__createCustodyRuntimeForTest`); `boot()` resolves before the interval is armed; a no-op runtime exists when custody is disabled so `dispose()` is always safe.

**`ClaustrumCredentialCache`:**
- Purpose: Cache vault-served credentials, single-flight their fetches, and fence an auth failure back to the vault.
- Location: `packages/core/src/custody.ts`
- Pattern: Resident record per handle plus an in-flight map; `get(handle, minTtlMs, {force})` collapses concurrent force fetches; `reportAuthFailure` is version-fenced with a two-report one-hour reauth bound, invalidating the reported resident version so a follow-up `get` cannot re-serve it.

**`QuotaManager`:**
 - Purpose: Single source of truth for in-memory main + per-fallback quota. Inflight dedup per fingerprint so concurrent calls with different tokens never cross-pollute.
 - Location: `packages/core/src/quota-manager.ts`
- Pattern: Push-only (no `fetchQuotaFn` injected — quota comes via `setMain`/`setFallback`); active refresh is orchestrated by `refreshAllQuota`.

**`BackgroundQuotaRefresh`:**
- Purpose: Periodic background quota polling for idle accounts across processes with an auto-renewing cross-process lease lock (`bg-quota-refresh`), per-window freshness gating, and timestamp-based snapshot merging.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/core/background-quota-refresh.ts`
- Pattern: Unref'd interval timer with jitter; non-blocking cancellation (`isStopped()` check before writing sidebar state); serialized cross-process execution via `acquireBackgroundRefreshLock`.

**Sticky candidate selection:**
- Purpose: Cold-session candidate selection, sustainable spend-rate weighting, and sticky-break classification.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/core/sticky-routing.ts`
- Pattern: Pure functions (`selectStickyCandidate`, `decideStickyBreak`, `sustainableWindowWeight`) calculating quota pressure divided by sustainable spendable rate, where the credit budget participates as its own axis on its own reset; excludes stale or killswitch-failing accounts; falls open to configured order. Reads the shared `spendControlExhaustedResetAt` signal so cold placement, admission, and warm-pin migration agree on what "spent" means.

**`CacheKeepManager`:**
- Purpose: Idle prompt-cache warmer with per-session targets, idle caps (1 h main / 30 min subagent, extended to 75 min for GPT-5.6 subagents), clock window checks, and 10-min backoff after a failed warm. Main-only `sustain` bypasses idle pruning without affecting the other bounds.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/core/cachekeep.ts`
- Pattern: Target map keyed by session id; interval timer; bounded (`maxTargets`, `maxBytes`) so a long-lived process cannot leak; model-aware TTL adjustment (30-min TTL for GPT-5.6 models) and gpt-5.6 subagent 2-warm limits.

**Reset credit redemption coordinator:**
- Purpose: Preview reset-credit eligibility and redeem exactly one explicit credit for an exhausted account after identity-bound confirmation.
 - Location: `packages/core/src/reset-credits.ts`; command orchestration in `packages/core/src/commands.ts` (`executeResetCommand` shared body).
- Pattern: Persisted `(creditId, redeemRequestId)` claim before the consume POST; confirm-time identity and new-attempt precondition checks; terminal-only finalization with bounded, identifier-stable retry for ambiguous outcomes.

**`OpenAIWebSocketPool` / `createWebSocketFetch`:**
- Purpose: Session-keyed WebSocket pool with continuation chaining (`previous_response_id`), refusal cleanup (clearing continuation state and destroying the socket so retries re-send full input), oversized frame (1009) HTTP relay fallback (`relayWithOversizedFallback`), per-account discriminator so a switch forces a fresh socket, and stream-failure retries.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/ws-pool.ts`
- Pattern: `Map<accountDiscriminator, PoolEntry>`; lazy WS upgrades; pool entry owns its `turnID`/`turnStartedAt` so a single user turn keeps one Codex turn id across the whole tool loop; owns the response body so pre-output oversized frame rejections seamlessly complete over HTTP.

**Loopback RPC server:**
- Purpose: Notification queue + apply dispatch between loader and TUI.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/rpc/`
- Pattern: HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` with a 32-byte bearer token written to `port-<pid>.json`; client discovers via pid-liveness scan of the dir.

**Sidebar snapshot:**
- Purpose: Loader → TUI surface for quota/killswitch/routing without coupling the TUI to the auth storage schema; also owns machine-global sticky assignments.
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/sidebar-state.ts`
- Pattern: Promise-chained writes (no interleaved/stale writes); file path bound at loader-run time; `normalizeSidebarState` is the tolerant-read entry point so a malformed file never crashes the TUI. Writes machine-wide quota state via `setSidebarMachineState`, short-lived session display records via `upsertSidebarActiveRouting`, and SHA-256-keyed sticky assignments via `resolveSidebarStickyAssignment`; file locking and a promise serialization chain preserve concurrent placement and pending-byte accounting. Pins expire after seven days.

## Entry Points

**Plugin entry:**
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/index.ts` (`CodexAuthPlugin`)
- Triggers: OpenCode loads `@cortexkit/opencode-openai-auth` per `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` `plugin` field.
- Responsibilities: Returns `Hooks`; `provider.models` filters the OpenAI model list (allow-list + GPT >5.4 fallback, disallowing bare `gpt-5.6`/`gpt-6`) and zeroes OAuth costs; `auth.loader` does the heavy lifting on first OAuth request and builds the custody runtime/bootstrap; `auth.fetch` is the per-request wrapper; `command.execute.before` returns `cleanAbort` for `/openai-*`; `tool.web_search` registers `HostedWebSearchTool`; `event` cleans session state on `session.deleted`; `dispose` closes WS, stops cachekeep, stops background refresh, stops background quota polling, and disposes the custody runtime.

**TUI entry:**
- Location: `packages/opencode/src/tui/entry.mjs` (exported as `./tui`; dispatches to the precompiled or raw TUI)
- Triggers: OpenCode TUI loads the plugin per its `oc-plugin: ["server", "tui"]` field.
- Responsibilities: Renders the sidebar (quota, fallback accounts, routing, health, pacing); polls the loader RPC for dialogs; dispatches Apply; reads/writes `tui-preferences.jsonc`.

**Pi extension entry:**
- Location: `packages/pi/src/index.ts` (`cortexKitPiOpenAIAuth`)
- Triggers: Pi loads the extension per its `pi.extensions` field.
- Responsibilities: Registers the `openai-codex` provider with model list, OAuth login/refresh, custom streaming wrapper that swaps `globalThis.WebSocket` for the hand-rolled client.

## Error Handling

**Strategy:** Fail-soft with structured retry; never break a request because of a quota or logging concern.

- Refresh errors: classified transient by `isTransientRefreshError`; build a `nextRetryAt` and store it in `refresh.lastRefreshError`. A `refreshBackoffActive` check short-circuits future refresh attempts for the same token hash.
- Quota errors: classified by `isTransientQuotaError`; `quotaBackoffActive` gates future quota fetches per account.
- Token-refresh race: file lock + lease token hash in storage prevent two processes from refreshing the same main token simultaneously; late processes either join or wait via `waitForConcurrentMainRefresh`.
- Storage lock acquire timeouts: the acquire deadline is separated from lock TTL, and the timeout message reports attempt count and average gap between attempts to distinguish genuine holder contention from host event-loop starvation.
- Request-path telemetry: `markUsed` writes run fire-and-forget and swallow failures so lock contention or store read errors never kill a served response.
- HTTP/WS stream failures: `response-stream-error.ts` `ResponseStreamError` (supports `retryable` parameter); WS retries up to 5 times (`streamRetries`); `websocket_connection_limit_reached` (including during socket prewarm) falls back to HTTP for the session immediately. Oversized request frames (peer close code 1009) are classified non-retryable on WebSocket (`isOversizedFrame`), include the serialized request frame size in the error message, and trigger HTTP fallback via `relayWithOversizedFallback` if no output has streamed yet to complete the turn.
- Refused continuations: when a continuation fails or is closed before output, the socket is destroyed and continuation state is cleared (`entry.continuation = undefined`) so subsequent attempts never chain to a refused response and re-send full input instead.
- Peer close frame race: `RawWebSocket` implementations (`raw-ws-bun.ts`, `raw-ws-node.ts`) record parsed peer close frames (`peerClose`) so explicit peer close codes (such as 1009) take precedence over the synthetic 1006 TCP close event.
- Mid-stream rate-limiting / quota exhaustion: parsed from `response.failed` frames carrying `rate_limit_reached_type`, admission-time `usage_limit_reached` frames, or handshake 429 upgrade rejections. If `emittedOutput` is false (no generated output items emitted), triggers a retryable `ResponseStreamError` enabling a same-turn fallback reroute. If `emittedOutput` is true, closes the stream without retrying (no-replay gate) to prevent text duplication, double-billing, or re-running side-effecting tool calls, and annotates the error message with `(not retried: output already emitted)` and continuation provenance `(continuation of <previousResponseID>)` when applicable. Marks the account rate-limited using explicit provider resets when available, or reset math resolved from that window's last-known cached reset (falling back to a bounded default if unknown).
- 401/403/429 mid-request: handled by `tryFallbackAccounts` (reactive); the original body must be a string (else skip fallback).
- Storage corruption: `loadAccounts` is wrapped to throw a clear actionable message rather than a raw `JSON.parse` error.
- CLI self-fallback rejection: the account-menu `add` action refuses to add the main account as a fallback (would re-route a `429` onto the same account).
- Reserved account ID rejection: `"main"` is a reserved ID (case-insensitive); the OAuth callback login path and the `mutateAccounts` roster guard reject any fallback account using this label to avoid colliding with the primary account's tracking.
- Claustrum custody refusal: a custody-refused or custody-excluded account is never served or locally refreshed — `resolveFallbackAccess` returns `CUSTODY_REFUSE`/`CUSTODY_EXCLUDED`, and `refreshAllQuota` reports a vault-served quota 401 back to the vault rather than as a quota-endpoint failure. A `CustodyTombstoneRefreshError` (status 503) is the wired-in short-circuit for a tombstoned slot.
- Custody transition crash rows: the mode write is monotone — before it nothing destructive happened and re-running the transition is safe; after it resume tombstones only fingerprint-matching slots. There is no rollback after the mode write, and a host `Auth.set` landing outside the plugin's locks becomes `INERT:new-local-family-under-claustrum`, never a deletion target.
- Background refresh concurrency: `FallbackAccountManager` catches `AccountRemovedDuringRefreshError` to gracefully skip updates for fallback accounts removed from storage during a background refresh operation.
- Token refresh rotation tolerance: `codexRefreshFn` tolerates missing or empty `refresh_token` strings when the provider declines to rotate, preserving the existing refresh token without failing.
- Quota endpoint 401 handling: treated as a refresh trigger; accounts with armed non-transient refresh backoff are skipped during background quota polls and flagged permanent, advising operators to remove and re-add the account instead of retrying indefinitely.
- Load-time drop preservation: `mutateAccounts` and `saveAccounts` preserve un-loadable raw config entries on disk across writes rather than silently deleting them, requiring explicit `allowDrop` from callers (such as the account-menu delete-all action) for intentional removals.
- Token persistence retry: `persistMainAuthTokens` retries writing refreshed main auth tokens up to 3 times to handle transient client/storage update lock contentions.
- RPC state sweep: startup cleanup sweeps dead-PID port files and empty RPC directories with narrow parsing and validation so corrupted port files cannot abort directory sweeps for other projects.
- Command RPC credential scrubbing: `buildDialogPayload` scrubs credential keys from knob payloads and logs warnings rather than leaking tokens across the RPC boundary.
- All catch paths around quota/sidebar/RPC are best-effort by design; failures are logged at `warn` and swallowed so a sidebar/dump/RPC hiccup never crashes a turn.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Logging:** Leveled logger engine in `packages/core/src/logger.ts`, initialized per host by `packages/opencode/src/logger.ts` (log file + env level). Channels: `transport`, `quota`, `refresh`, `accounts`, `cachekeep`, `custody`, `models`, `rpc`, `rpc-tui`, `dump`, `sidebar`, `commands`. Redacts Bearer/sk-/JWT tokens, secret/api-key/password/token-like headers, ChatGPT stable ID (`chatgpt-account-id`/`chatgptAccountId`), and any value matching the secret-key patterns, while keeping the internal account ID visible. Custody handle values and credential payloads never reach the custody log channel. Transport lifecycle and stream failures log to `transport` independent of dump settings so errors leave records at normal log levels. Log files, request dumps, and the default dump directory are restricted to private permissions (`0o600` for files, `0o700` for directories). Credentials and tokens are redacted from request dump bodies as well as log files, while `redactStrings` preserves tool schemas in dumps so definitions remain parseable and replayable. File rotates at 5 MiB keeping 3 generations; default file `tmpdir/opencode-openai-auth.log` (override `OPENCODE_OPENAI_AUTH_LOG_FILE`). Log level is settable at runtime via `/openai-logging` (persisted) or env `OPENCODE_OPENAI_AUTH_LOG_LEVEL`.

**Caching:** Two layers.
- **In-memory quota cache:** `QuotaManager` (per-account fingerprint; 5-min refresh-after default; `respectBackoff` gates active polling).
- **Prompt cache keep-warm:** `CacheKeepManager` tracks per-session last request and replays as `store:false` before the Codex ~5-min eviction window.

`/openai-cachekeep sustain on|off` is main-agent-only and defaults off. It is orthogonal to the clock window, retains memory/LRU limits, and never warms a non-active account. GPT-5.6 targets warm about twice per hour per session (about 1K output tokens/hour at about 99.4% cache hit); non-5.6 targets warm about twelve times per hour. Before enabling it for a main-session model, the operator must preserve existing entries in `~/.config/cortexkit/magic-context.jsonc` and set that model's `cache_ttl` to `"never"`. Magic Context does not run in subagent sessions. An indefinitely live cache invalidates elapsed-time assumptions that a cache is cold and that mutation is free. The sibling anthropic plugin's `always` means ignore the clock schedule; this plugin's `sustain` means bypass main idle pruning.

**Storage:** Config and state are stored in two separate files under `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`: config at `openai-auth.json` (default `~/.config/opencode/openai-auth.json`, overridable via `OPENCODE_OPENAI_AUTH_FILE`) containing settings and metadata without credentials, and state at `openai-auth-state.json` (overridable via `OPENCODE_OPENAI_AUTH_STATE_FILE`) containing access/refresh tokens and API keys; `deriveStatePath` in `core/account-paths.ts` derives distinct state files (`<configPath>.state.json`) when custom config paths are used, and `accountPathsCollide` validates against path collisions. Atomic writes via `writeJsonAtomic` (temp + `rename`, mode `0o600`). File-level locks at `<config>.save.lock` and `<config>.main-refresh.lock` coordinate cross-process refresh and quota seed. A separate `openai-auth-sessions.json` persists Codex UUIDv7 thread/turn ids for prompt-cache continuity. Sidebar state lives at `tmpdir/opencode-openai-auth/sidebar-state.json` (override `OPENCODE_OPENAI_AUTH_SIDEBAR_STATE_FILE`). Loopback RPC port files live in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cortexkit/openai-auth/rpc/openai-auth-<sha256(projectDir)>/port-<pid>.json` (mode `0o600`, directories `0o700`); dead port files and empty project directories are swept on server startup.

**Configuration resolution (`config.ts`):** Env wins over config file wins over default. The `webSearch` cache fix is default-on and gated by a NEGATIVE env (`CORTEXKIT_OPENAI_AUTH_NO_WEB_SEARCH`). Booleans accept `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` and `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`/empty. Settings are memoized per process; commands that write configuration on disk (such as `/openai-dump`) invoke `refreshSettings()` to invalidate the memoized settings and pick up changes immediately. Tests call `resetSettingsForTest`.

**Versioning & build:** `packages/opencode/src/version.ts` exposes `PackageVersion` (currently `0.7.2`); the TUI plugin header reads `package.json` at runtime via `import.meta.url` so the version badge tracks the package version without baking it into the dist. Use `packages/opencode/scripts/build-tui.ts` during the build to precompile TUI Solid JSX source files into `packages/opencode/src/tui-compiled/` using the `@opentui/solid` compiler transform, binding Solid/OpenTUI imports to the host's virtual runtime registry (`opentui:runtime-module:<specifier>`) so the TUI shares the host's single Solid/OpenTUI runtime. The release pipeline is tag-driven (`.github/workflows` + `scripts/release.sh`); see `README.md` for the exact command surface.

**Formatting/linting:** Biome 2.5.13 (single quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas, 2-space indent). Lefthook runs `biome check` on staged files. Tests run via `bun test src/tests`; typecheck via `tsc`.
