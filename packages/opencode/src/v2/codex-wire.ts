// What openai-auth changes in the requests OpenCode 2's own OpenAI driver
// sends, so they match what it sends from OpenCode 1 (`prepareCodexRequest`
// in `src/index.ts`):
//
// - the Codex client identity (`version`, `user-agent`, `originator`), sent
//   as header edits with the account headers. They never change within a
//   session: the host keys a session's WebSocket on its handshake headers,
//   so a header that changed between requests would open a new socket and
//   resend the whole conversation;
// - a mid-conversation reasoning-effort change carried as a
//   `configuration_update` item while the request-level effort stays at the
//   session's first value (`MidConversationEffort`), on HTTP bodies and on
//   WebSocket frames;
// - the Responses Lite body for the models marked Lite, on HTTP only
//   (`responsesLiteHttpBody`; why not on WebSocket is explained there).

 * both act on one request.
 *
 * OpenCode 2.0.22 also carries `gpt-6.1-sol` itself, measured with the real
 * host: the request-level effort stays pinned, the turn whose effort changed
 * carries one update item and stays chained. `gpt-6.1-sol` is still left out
 * of this list so a 2.0.21 host keeps getting the rewrite; on 2.0.22 the

 * effort (`MID_CONVERSATION_EFFORT_MODELS`) and the host does not carry the
 * change itself (`HOST_EFFORT_UPDATE_MODEL`): `gpt-6.1-sol`, which only
 * 2.0.21 needs it for.
 *
 * The backend keys its prompt cache on the request-level
 * `reasoning.effort`, so a session that changes effort part-way would have
 * the whole conversation read again uncached. Instead the request-level
 * value stays at the effort the session opened with, and the new effort goes
 * in as `{type: 'configuration_update', reasoning: {effort}}` immediately
 * before the user message that starts the current turn (the last user
 * message of the input). Only the agent loop's requests (`kind` `primary`)
 * take part; a session's first one with an effort pins it.
 *
 * The rule only ever adds to what the host built: it sets the request-level
 * effort back to the pinned value and inserts the one item. It never drops,
 * reorders or edits anything else, and never touches `previous_response_id`.
 * Given the session's pinned effort, the result depends on the body alone.
 *
 * Per form:
 *
 * - HTTP: every request replays the whole conversation, so the item rides
 *   on every request after a change, before the turn's user message; the
 *   tool steps of a turn keep it at the same place, so their prefix stays
 *   cached from one step to the next.
 * - WebSocket: the host chains turns with `previous_response_id` and sends
 *   only the new input items, comparing against its own request as it was
 *   before this rewrite. The server keeps the items it has seen, the
 *   inserted update among them, so the item goes only on a frame whose
 *   input holds a user message (a new turn, or a full resend); a frame that
 *   carries only tool output keeps the pinned request-level effort and
 *   relies on the update already in the server's history. On 2.0.21, when
 *   the user changes effort the host itself sends that turn as a full frame
 *   (its request changed); the frame keeps the pinned effort, so the server
 *   reads the replayed conversation from its cache, and the following
 *   turns go out incremental again.
 *
 * An update is never placed right after another one (the API refuses two in
 * a row), and an input with no user message gets no item. The response
 * keeps reporting the request-level (pinned) effort, as on OpenCode 1.
