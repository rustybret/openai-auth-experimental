// OpenCode 1's login slot, read from OpenCode 2.
//
// The account-pool migration (`core/pool-migration.ts`) moves the credential
// in OpenCode 1's `openai` login slot into pool row `main` and leaves the
// slot a placeholder. OpenCode 2 keeps its own credentials in its database,
// so under OpenCode 2 the slot the migration reads is OpenCode 1's
// `auth.json` itself, through the same `get`/`set`/`all` shape as OpenCode
// 1's `client.auth`. That keeps one migration path, one fence and one pool
// for both hosts: an install that runs OpenCode 1 again afterwards finds the
// placeholder and the migrated pool, exactly as if OpenCode 1 had migrated.
//
// OpenCode 1 rewrites `auth.json` whole, from its own read, without a lock
// this process could take. So the placeholder write here narrows what it can
// lose as far as the file allows: it re-reads the file at once before
// writing, refuses to write when the `openai` login is no longer the one the
// migration last read (the migration ends retryably and plans again later),
// changes only the `openai` key, and renames a complete file into place with
// the mode the file already has. What stays open is the few milliseconds
// between that re-read and the rename: a whole-file write by OpenCode 1 that
// lands inside them is either overwritten by the rename (its change is lost)
// or overwrites the placeholder (the migration's read-back then reports the
// placeholder overwritten, and the slot still holds a real login).

 * auth map reads non-empty (an empty map from OpenCode 1's API can be a torn
 * read mid-write); a file read here is either parsed whole or refused, so an
 * absent or empty file is a definite "no OpenCode 1 login on this machine".
 *
 * A write in progress cannot pass for that: OpenCode 1 either truncates and
 * rewrites the file, where a read in between sees no text or a cut-off
 * object, which fails to parse and is refused; or it renames a complete file
 * into place, which never leaves the path missing. An `auth.json` holding
 * exactly `{}` is a finished write of no logins.
