// The OpenCode 2 server plugin: openai-auth's account pool on OpenCode 2's own
// OpenAI driver, through `@cortexkit/common-auth/opencode2`.
//
// What setup wires, in order:
// 1. The pool source (`core/pool-account-source.ts`) over the same config and
//    state files OpenCode 1 uses: the pool is the one authority for accounts
//    on both hosts.
// 2. This process's heartbeat and, while the migration switch
//    (`POOL_MIGRATION_ENABLED` in `../index.ts`, the one OpenCode 1 obeys)
//    is on, the background pool migration (`core/pool-lifecycle.ts`), with
//    OpenCode 1's `auth.json` as the login slot (`host-slot.ts`). An install
//    that has not migrated yet then migrates on the first OpenCode 2 start,
//    behind the same version fence as on OpenCode 1; until then the pool
//    serves nothing and pool requests are refused locally.
//
//    While the switch is off nothing migrates. An install that is already
//    migrated is served from its pool as below, without adoptions of later
//    slot logins (OpenCode 1 runs none either). On one that is not, the
//    plugin installs only gated hooks to refuse a cached pool placeholder:
//    no login methods, model rules or vault. That install's accounts live in
//    OpenCode 1's
//    `auth.json` and openai-auth's legacy roster, which only OpenCode 1's
//    request path can serve; OpenCode 2 keeps serving the ChatGPT login in
//    its own credential table through its built-in OpenAI plugin, and no
//    credential is read, copied or moved. Real host credentials pass through.
// 3. This host's Claustrum vault connection (`OpenAiVault` in the core
//    package, enrolled as `openai-auth-opencode`, the name OpenCode 1 uses),
//    While this host is enrolled (vault mode) its OpenAI accounts are the
//    only ones routed: no pool row is sent with, refreshed or polled. Nothing
//    above waits for its first roster read; the lifecycle's adoptions wait
//    for it in the background, and a vault-mode request for at most two
//    seconds before it is refused.
// 4. The hooks recipe (`installOpenCode2Auth`) with openai-auth's adapter
//    (`adapter.ts`): account choice, credential headers, request rewrites,
//    quota, refusals.
// 5. The ChatGPT logins (`login.ts`), writing into the pool; OpenCode 2's
//    credential table only ever receives a placeholder.
// 6. The model rules (`models.ts`).
