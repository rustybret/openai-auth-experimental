// Moves openai-auth's accounts into the shared account pool of
// `@cortexkit/common-auth/store`, and keeps adopting real logins that later
// land in OpenCode's own login slot.
//
// Before the pool, the main account's credential lived in OpenCode's login
// slot (`auth.json`, key `openai`) and fallbacks lived in openai-auth's
// config and state files. In the pool every account is a row of those files
// and the slot holds a placeholder that is never sent. The plugin runs the
// migration and later adoptions in the background (`pool-lifecycle.ts`),
// never on the request path.
//
// Crash-safety rule: the slot keeps the only unmoved copy of its credential
// until the pool holds it and a reload has proved it; only then is the
// placeholder written, and only through a fence (the slot must still hold
// the exact access/refresh pair that was read). A durable pending-transfer
// record, written before a row is touched, lets any later run tell whether
// an interrupted transfer never happened, finished, or was overtaken.
//
// While a transfer is in flight the slot and the row may hold the same
// token, and `mainAccountId` (the shield) names the row's identity so older
// builds leave the row alone. The shield is dropped only after the
// placeholder is in the slot, in the same write that clears the record, so
// the two copies never stand unshielded, crash or not.
//
// Pre-tolerant openai-auth builds (0.11.0 and earlier) honour the shield
// only when picking a fallback for a request: their background refresh
// refreshes every enabled roster row (the migrated `main` row included)
// under a per-account fallback lock, and the slot credential under the
// `main-refresh` lock plus a lease in `state.main`. After a crash with both
// copies in place they would refresh one token twice, and with the
// placeholder in while the shield is still up they cannot serve main at
// all. So the migration runs only while no older process is alive (the
// version fence, `version-fence.ts`, is a required input of
// `migrateToPool`). The tolerant release shipped ahead of this migration
// honours the shield in its background refresh too, and serves main from
// row `main` whenever the slot holds the placeholder. Every step here that
// copies a credential still takes the legacy locks, which covers an older
// process the fence could not see: one started after the check. What the
// fence does not cover is a downgrade, after a migration ran or crashed, to
// a pre-tolerant version (older than the first release that writes the
// process heartbeat `version-fence.ts` reads); that downgrade is
// unsupported.
//
// Lock order. A pool refresh (`refreshPoolRow`) takes the row's pool lock,
// then the provider-wide lock, then the legacy `main-refresh` and fallback
// locks. A transfer's row write takes the same locks in the same order: the
// legacy locks go to the store as `extraLocks`, never held before it. So a
// run holds only its own run lock (`POOL_MIGRATION_LOCK_NAME`, which no
// refresh takes) while the store waits for a row lock, and a refresh waiting
// for `main-refresh` can never be waiting on this run. `main-refresh` is
// taken on its own again, after the row write, around the placeholder write.
//
// The whole plugin's file locks, outermost first. A code path that holds one
// of them and waits for another always waits for one further down this list.
// "Waited" means polled until a timeout (the store's own locks, this file's
// `acquireLock`, `withMainRefreshLock`, the legacy `save` pair); "tried"
// means one attempt that gives up at once when the lock is held.
//  1. `pool-migration` at the config path: a migration or adoption run,
//     held from start to end (waited). Only tried anywhere else.
//  2. `bg-quota-refresh` at the config path: one background quota pass
//     (`background-quota-refresh.ts`, tried), around the pool refreshes and
//     polls or the legacy fallback refreshes and polls of that pass. Never
//     held together with lock 1.
//  3. The store's row lock, `row-<identity or id>` at the state path
//     (waited, by the store: row writes, refresh, identity records).
//  4. The store's provider-wide lock, `provider-openai` at the state path
//     (waited, by the store, after the row lock: OAuth row writes, refresh).
//  5. `main-refresh` at the config path. Waited when the store takes it as
//     an extra lock (pool refresh, row writes, the `/openai` menu, settings
//     writes: `legacyRefreshLocks`, `poolSettingsLocks` in
//     `pool-accounts.ts`), here around the placeholder write
//     (`finishTransfer`) and by the login's slot write
//     (`withMainRefreshLock`, from `auth/methods.ts`). Tried by the slot refresh
//     (`refreshMainWithLease` in `index.ts`).
//  6. `fallback-refresh-<id>` at the config path. Waited as the store's
//     extra lock after `main-refresh`; tried by the legacy fallback refresh
//     (`FallbackAccountManager` in the core package).
//  7. The quota-poll locks `opencode-main-quota-refresh` and
//     `opencode-fallback-quota-refresh-<id>` at the config path (the core
//     package's `QuotaManager`, tried; nothing of this plugin is taken while
//     one is held).
//  8. `save` at the config path, then `save` at the state path (waited): the
//     store's own locks, which it takes last in every operation and releases
//     before it calls a refresh's provider; the legacy `mutateAccounts`,
//     `saveAccounts` and `saveAccountState` (the last takes the state one
//     alone); and `updateConfig` below. Nothing is taken while they are held.
// Leaf locks of their own files, never held while another lock is taken and
// never taken while one of the above is held: `sidebar-write` at the sidebar
// file, and the vault's `claustrum-roster` then `claustrum-roster-write` at
// the vault roster file (both in `@cortexkit/common-auth`).
//
// One acquisition runs against this order, and only as a try: the slot
// refresh holds `main-refresh` (5) and tries the run lock (1) in
// `reclaimExpiredPoolTransfer`. A run that holds the run lock and waits for
// `main-refresh` therefore never waits on a slot refresh that waits on it:
// the try fails at once and the record is kept.
//
// Between reading the slot and the row write nothing legacy is held, so the
// slot's token could be refreshed (and spent) in that gap. The pending
// record closes it: the record is written first, then any active legacy
// lease and then the slot are read again. This build's own slot refresh
// (`refreshMainWithLease` in `index.ts`) checks for a record covering its
// token in the same locked write that sets its lease, and stands down if it
// finds one (`poolTransferPendingFor`). Either its lease was set first (the
// re-read sees the lease, or the rotated slot once the lease is gone) or the
// record was (and it never refreshes). An older build does not look for the
// record; the version fence keeps older builds away from the migration, the
// background runner (`pool-lifecycle.ts`) applies the same fence before each
// adoption, and the placeholder fence below restarts a transfer whose slot
// moved on to a new token of the same account.

 * record gone the refresh goes ahead, and the next migration or adoption run
 * starts over the way it does after a crash: with no record, it plans from
 * the slot as it then stands.
 *
 * The record stays when:
 * - a run is live (it holds the run lock, `POOL_MIGRATION_LOCK_NAME`, which
 *   is only tried here, never waited for): that run owns the transfer;
 * - the install is migrated and the record's row already holds the token:
 *   the pool's own refresh of that row now owns it, and the slot refreshing
 *   it too would spend one token twice. Before the migration is marked done
 *   the pool refreshes no row, and older builds' background refresh skips
 *   the row the shield (`mainAccountId`, which stays up) names, so there the
 *   slot is the only refresher left and the record can go.
 *
 * When the record's row holds neither its credential from before the
 * transfer nor the slot's (it was rotated since, the case `plan` calls
 * ambiguous), the slot's token may already be spent: the transfer may have
 * copied it into the row before the row was rotated. The record still goes,
 * so the slot refresh can try the token, but the slot value is declined for
 * adoption in the same write (`declinedSlotFingerprint`, as an `ambiguous`
 * run leaves it). A refresh that renews the token changes the slot value and
 * the renewed login is adopted as usual; a spent token fails to refresh,
 * stays in the slot as it was, and never replaces the row.
 *
 * `slotAccess` is the access token the slot holds beside `refreshToken`; the
 * declined value is that exact pair. Without it the record's own slot value
 * is declined.
