// Refuses to build when an installed dependency does not satisfy the range its
// package declares, including the separately installed real-host fixtures.
//
// `bun install --frozen-lockfile` does not check this. It only asks whether a
// package.json implies changes to the lockfile; it never checks the lockfile
// against the manifests. Measured on this repo: with `packages/core` declaring
// `@cortexkit/claustrum-client` as exactly "0.3.0", swapping the lockfile's
// entry to 0.2.0 plus that version's genuine integrity hash installs 0.2.0 and
// exits 0. Pinning the manifest does not help, because the manifest is never
// consulted.
//
// That matters more than usual here because the build inlines dependencies.
// Whatever version is installed at build time is the version every user runs,
// and nothing on their side resolves it again. So this runs first in `build`,
// where it guards the exact tree that gets bundled and published.
